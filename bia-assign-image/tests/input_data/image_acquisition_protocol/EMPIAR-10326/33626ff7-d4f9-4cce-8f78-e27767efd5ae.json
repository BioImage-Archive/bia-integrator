  "protocol_description": "FIB SEM data was collected using a Crossbeam 540 FIB SEM with Atlas 5 for 3-dimensional tomography acquisition. Images were acquired at 5 nm isotropic resolution throughout each region of interest, using a 10 ms dwell time. The SEM was operated at an accelerating voltage of 1.5 kV with 1 nA current. The EsB detector was used with a grid voltage of 1,200 V. Ion beam milling was performed at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV and current of 700 pA.",
