Following background correction, Cellpose was used to segment individual nuclei using the Hoechst channel for each Z-slice.  Cellpose labels were consolidated by unifying masks with the greatest overlap, provided that any overlapping mask was more than 50% of each stack's area.  After Segmentation, out-of focus z-stacks were removed by calculating normalized variance across all images in the z-stack using code from https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/find-focus#h.plx6cfnctssk, then removing those z-stacks with less than 80% of the maximal normalized variance value in that z-stack, and returning the largest contiguous section of remaining z-slices.  After trimming out-of focus z-slices, each nuclei was segmented for puncta.   For each nucleus: voxels in the bottom 95% of intensity values were removed, as well as all voxels with less than twice the median intensity value. Of the remaining pixels, those not adjacent to any other pixel were also removed.   The resulting image was blurred using a gaussian filter, then segmented using cellpose.  Puncta within a nucleus were combined across z-stacks using the same algorithm that evaluated overlap across z-stacks.  Nuclei properties such as # of puncta per nuclei were then calculated using the analysis code published in Baggett et. al.."
