Notes on creating the files in this directory:

1. Copy supported formats from https://bio-formats.readthedocs.io/en/stable/supported-formats.html
2. Paste into spreadsheet or text editor and get all extensions
3. Ensure extensions are unique and sorted
4. Manually curate into 'bioformats_curated_single_file_formats.txt' Which have 1-2-1 conversion with bioformats2raw and bioformats_curated_other_file_formats.txt which require more input for conversion (e.g. pattern files)
