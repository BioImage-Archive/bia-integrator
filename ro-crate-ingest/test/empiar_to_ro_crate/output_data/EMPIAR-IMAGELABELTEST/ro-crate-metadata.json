Manually curated template matching for ribosomes and non-exhaustive manual picking for FAS (step 1; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) were used for training 3D CNNs (step 2). CNN predictions were masked with a segmentation of the cytosol. For ribosomes, step 2 was repeated three times (always trained on combined predictions of step 1 and the preceding round) and each round consisted of three simultaneously trained networks with default hyperparameters (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), except for the number of IF\u2009=\u20094, 8, and 32, to provide a cumulative prediction that is less overfitted to the incomplete training data. Cumulative predictions were manually revised in tom_chooser (ribosomes) and in EMAN2 (FAS) and manual picking was performed in either spectrum-matched or Gaussian-filtered tomograms (\u03c3\u2009=\u20093) for up to three rounds in EMAN2 spt2_boxer (step 3; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The particle lists were cleaned for duplicates by applying elliptic distance constraints to the coordinates (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Template matching for ribosomes was performed with pyTOM by a 3D cross-correlation search over 1,944 Euler angle combinations using the large subunit of S. cerevisiae 80S ribosome map (EMDB accession EMD-3228) scaled to the corresponding pixel size, and a spherical mask (diameter 337\u2009\u00c5). The 2,000\u20133,000 highest cross correlation scores were manually revised in Gaussian-filtered tomograms (\u03c3\u2009=\u20093) with tom_chooser (pyTOM toolbox).
