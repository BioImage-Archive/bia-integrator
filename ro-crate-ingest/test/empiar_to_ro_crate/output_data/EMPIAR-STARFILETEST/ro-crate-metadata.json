Spherical labels of 137 \u00c5 radius were generated based on the coordinates of 161 manually picked particles in EMAN2. A DeePiCt network of depth 2, with 32 initial features and batch normalization, was trained with an increasing number of particles and iterative refinement of coordinates via subtomogram averaging. The initial training set contained 161 particles from 39 tomograms, whereas the final training set contained 1284 particles from 71 tomograms. The number of grids and tomograms for the GEM2-labelled Mito-EGFP were six grids, 12 lamellae and 17 tomograms. Application of the CNN on 17 tomograms of the Mito-EGFP data set yielded 68 peaks after stringent postprocessing, which included thresholding at a value of 0.5, application of a lamella mask and a size filter for connected components of 5,000\u201350,000\u2009pixels at 13.7\u2009\u00c5/pixel. Of the 68 peaks, two were discarded due to being in a lysosome or mitochondrion, three discarded due to beam-induced damage of the lamella surface and three were cytosolic but did not resemble a GEM visually. On visual inspection of smaller-sized peaks, 63 particles were added manually for subtomogram averaging.",

Then, 2.0 \u00d7 10^5 trypsinized cells were seeded onto Au SiO2 R1.2/20 Quantifoil grids (200 mesh) micropatterned with 30-\u00b5m fibronectin circles in the center of grid squares, placed in ibidi 35 mm low dishes (six grids per dish) and incubated in 1 ml of medium for 1 h. After cell attachment, grids were transferred to new ibidi 35 mm low dishes and further cultured in 1 ml of medium containing 2 \u00b5g ml\u22121 doxycycline for 1 day. Cells were stained with 50 nM Halo-JF646 for 1 h to label GEMs and then treated with 0.5 \u00b5M rapalog for 30 min. To verify GEM2 expression and labeling before freezing, fluorescence imaging was performed. For freezing, 3 \u00b5l of medium was added to the cell side of grids before blotting to reduce cell flattening. Grids were blotted from the back for 1\u20133 s at 37 \u00b0C, 90% humidity and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane at \u2212185 \u00b0C on a Leica EM GP2 system, clipped into cryo-FIB auto-grids and stored in sealed boxes in liquid nitrogen. Lamellae were prepared using a 45\u00b0-pretilt shuttle in an Aquilos FIB-SEM microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before milling, metallic platinum was deposited by sputter coating (1 kV, 10 mA, 10 Pa, 15\u201320 s), and organometallic platinum via the gas injection system at a working distance of 10.6 mm and injection times of 8\u201311 s. Cells were milled to 1-\u03bcm thickness at a stage tilt of 20\u00b0 with decreasing ion beam currents (1, 0.5 and 0.3 nA, 30 keV) and then thinned all together to a target thickness of 200\u2013250 nm at 50 and 30 pA. Lamellae were thinned at the back at a stage tilt of 21\u201322\u00b0, and finally sputter-coated with platinum (1 kV, 10 mA, 10 Pa, 5\u201315 s) to reduce charging and beam-induced motion during TEM imaging. Milling progress was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (10 keV, 50 pA). For cryogenic on-lamella CLEM, milled grids were loaded onto a Zeiss LSM 900 Airyscan2 microscope equipped with a Linkam cryo-stage. Using a \u00d75 air objective in widefield mode, an overview image was acquired to localize lamellae. Next, z-stacks with 0.5\u2009\u00b5m spacing covering 4\u20136\u2009\u00b5m were acquired in Airyscan mode with 488 and 640 laser lines and a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar \u00d7100/0.75\u2009NA air objective, using a pixel size of 79\u2009nm. In addition, reflection mode images were acquired for each z-plane. For each image, four averages between frames were acquired to increase signal-to-noise ratio.",
