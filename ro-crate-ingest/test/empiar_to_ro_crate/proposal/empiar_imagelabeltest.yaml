  ImageAcquisitionProtocol:
    - title: "Cryo-electron tomography"
      protocol_description: "Milled lamellae were loaded into a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) such that the axis of the pre-tilt introduced by FIB milling was aligned perpendicular to the tilt axis of the microscope. Tomograms were acquired on a K2 Summit direct detection camera (Gatan) operating in dose fractionation mode utilizing a Quantum post-column energy filter operated at zero-loss (Gatan). A calibrated pixel size of 3.45 Å was used for the NPC defocus* data and 3.37 Å for the remaining datasets. Up to 14 tilt series were collected on a single lamella in low dose mode using SerialEM. Starting from the lamella pre-tilt, images were acquired in 2° increments within a range of +58° to −40° using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme with a constant electron dose per tilt image. For ground truth data, a set of ten tilt series were either collected with a 70 μm objective aperture or a VPP56 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with prior conditioning for 5 min. NPC data was collected as described in previous work, but at 1.5–4.5 μm defocus, with 3° increments and an effective tilt range of +50° to −50°."

  SpecimenImagingPreparationProtocol:
    - title: "Cryo-ET sample preparation and focused ion beam (FIB) milling"
      protocol_description: "TEM grids with vitrified yeast cells were clipped into an autogrid with a cut-out. Mounted on a 45° pre-tilt shuttle, grids were transferred into an Aquilos Dual beam microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific), sputter-coated with platinum for 10–15 s (1 kV, 10 mA, 10 Pa), and subsequently coated with organometallic platinum using the gas injection system (8 s with the stage positioned 3 mm below the coincidence point). In three independent sessions, three grids with five lamellae each were processed at a milling angle of 15°. Agglomerations of several cells were thinned in three steps of rough milling to a thickness of 5 µm at 1 nA ion beam current, 3 µm at 0.5 nA and 1 µm at 0.1 nA. Milling progress was visually monitored between each milling step with the scanning electron microscope beam (10 kV, 50 pA). Fine milling was performed at 50 pA to a target thickness of 200 nm. To render the lamellae conductive for TEM imaging, grids were sputtered with platinum for 5 s (1 kV, 10 mA, 10 Pa) and transferred into cryo-boxes."
  AnnotationMethod:
    - title: "Annotation of ribosomes and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in VPP data"
      protocol_description: "Ribosome and FAS were localized in 4×-binned tomograms (13.48 Å voxel size) in an iterative workflow. Manually curated template matching for ribosomes and non-exhaustive manual picking for FAS (step 1; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) were used for training 3D CNNs (step 2). CNN predictions were masked with a segmentation of the cytosol. For ribosomes, step 2 was repeated three times (always trained on combined predictions of step 1 and the preceding round) and each round consisted of three simultaneously trained networks with default hyperparameters (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), except for the number of IF = 4, 8, and 32, to provide a cumulative prediction that is less overfitted to the incomplete training data. Cumulative predictions were manually revised in tom_chooser (ribosomes) and in EMAN2 (FAS) and manual picking was performed in either spectrum-matched or Gaussian-filtered tomograms (σ = 3) for up to three rounds in EMAN2 spt2_boxer (step 3; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The particle lists were cleaned for duplicates by applying elliptic distance constraints to the coordinates (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Template matching for ribosomes was performed with pyTOM by a 3D cross-correlation search over 1,944 Euler angle combinations using the large subunit of S. cerevisiae 80S ribosome map (EMDB accession EMD-3228) scaled to the corresponding pixel size, and a spherical mask (diameter 337 Å). The 2,000–3,000 highest cross correlation scores were manually revised in Gaussian-filtered tomograms (σ = 3) with tom_chooser (pyTOM toolbox). For FAS in the VPP dataset template matching with a published S. cerevisiae FAS33 map (EMDB accession EMD-1623) as reference failed."

    - title: "Annotation of ribosomes and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in defocus data"
      protocol_description: "A procedure similar to that used for VPP data was applied, except that: (i) the initial annotations for ribosomes were manually cleaned after template matching and initial FAS manual picking was incomplete; and (ii) in step 2 of the ribosomes ground truth construction, two of the three rounds of DeePiCt predictions were obtained using models trained on VPP data (first and second round of VPP ground truth construction; Supplementary Table 2)."

  Protocol:
    - title: "Tilt series preprocessing"
      protocol_description: "Tilt movie frames were aligned using a SerialEM plugin. Tilt series were filtered according to the accumulated electron dose by Fourier cropping using the mtffilter function in etomo (IMOD/BETA4.10.1258), and sorted by tilt angle using a python script. Four-times-binned tilt images were aligned in etomo (IMOD/4.9.4) using patch tracking (typical residual error 0.291–0.569 pixels)."
    - title: "Tomogram reconstruction"
      protocol_description: "Tomograms were reconstructed via weighted back projection. Tomogram thicknesses ranged between 80–310 nm."
