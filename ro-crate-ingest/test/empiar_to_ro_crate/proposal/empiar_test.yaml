    - title: "Serial Block Face SEM"
      protocol_description: "Images were acquired with an FEG-SEM Quanta 250 using a backscattered electron detector with a 2.5-kV beam voltage, a spot size of 3 and pressure between 0.1 and 0.3 Torr. Images were collected moving away from the stumped root tip in 40-nm steps."

      protocol_description: "Five-day-old Col-0 and plm-2 roots were fixed, dehydrated and embedded in Durcupan resin following protocols previously described in refs. 52,53. To improve handling, the roots were shortened to a total length of about 600 μm from the tip using a grinding machine (LaboPol-5, Struers). Ground roots were then mounted by the ground side to a 3View pin and trimmed from the opposite end to 240 μm from the root tip using an EM Ultracut UC6i ultramicrotome (Leica Mikrosysteme) and a diamond knife. The trimming distance was selected based on markers for SE enucleation to get as close as possible to the area of interest. As a control, a histological section was cut and checked after the trimming. The blocks were covered with silver paint (Agar Scientific) and platinum coated using Quorum Q150TS (Quorum Technologies)."
