  AnnotationMethod:
    - title: "Ribosome particle picking and refinement"
      protocol_description: To find the positions of macromolecular complexes within tomograms we either used the MolMatch software for template matching or manually picked particles using 3dmod and converted the resulting model into a text file using the IMOD model2point command.

  ImageAnalysisMethod:
    - title: "Sub-tomogram averaging in RELION"
      protocol_description: "The dataset was used for sub-tomogram averaging in RELION. Tomograms were processed according to Steps 1-7 as described in the protocol, with results stored in the ./AnticipatedResults subdirectory of the EMPIAR entry. To enter the RELION workflow, we assume that tomograms have been generated in MRC format. Tomogram calculation is not done inside RELION but instead relies on software packages such as IMOD, Tomo3D, pyTOM or Bsoft. In the examples in the paper, the IMOD package was used for tilt series alignment, and Tomo3D for tomographic reconstruction."
