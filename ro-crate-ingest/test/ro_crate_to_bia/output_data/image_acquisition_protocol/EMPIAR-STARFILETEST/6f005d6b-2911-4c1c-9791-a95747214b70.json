  "protocol_description": "Cryo-TEM montages and tilt series were collected on a Titan Krios G3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit detector and Quantum energy filter, or a Gatan K3 detector and BioQuantum energy filter, using SerialEM. Grids were loaded such that the lamella pretilt axis aligns with the microscope stage tilt axis. Images were acquired at a pixel size of 3.370 or 3.425 Å/pixel at 1.5–4.0 µm defocus, with an electron dose of 2.0–2.5 e−/Å2 per image fractionated over 8–10 frames. A dose-symmetric tilt scheme was used with 2° increments starting from the lamella pretilt (±13°) and an effective tilt range of +56° to −56° using SerialEM. Data were collected with a 70-µm objective aperture or a Volta phase plate, and 20 eV slit width.",
