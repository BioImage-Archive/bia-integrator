  "protocol_description": "Immunostaining of the U-2 OS FUCCI cells5 was performed in 96-well glass bottom plates (Whatman, GE Healthcare, UK, and Greiner Sensoplate Plus, Greiner Bio-One, Germany) coated with 50 μl of 12.5 μg/ml human fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Approximately 8,000 cells were seeded in each well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. After washing with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS, pH=7), cells were fixed with 40 μl 4% ice cold PFA (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) dissolved in growth medium supplemented with 10 % serum for 15 minutes and permeabilized with 40 μl 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 3x5 minutes. Rabbit polyclonal HPA antibodies targeting the proteins of interest were dissolved to 2-4 μg/ml in blocking buffer (PBS + 4% FBS) containing 1 μg/ml mouse anti-tubulin (Abcam, ab7291, Cambridge, UK). After washing with PBS, the diluted primary antibodies were added (40 μl/well) and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, wells were washed with PBS for 3x10 minutes. Secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse Alexa405 (A31553, ThermoFisher) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa647 (A21245, ThermoFisher) diluted to 2,5 μg /ml in blocking buffer were added and the plates were incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. After washing with PBS, all wells were mounted with PBS containing 78 % glycerol before being sealed."
