  "protocol_description": "U-2 OS FUCCI cells are endogenously tagged with two fluorescent proteins fused to cell cycle regulators to allow cell cycle monitoring; CDT1 (mKO2-hCdt1+) accumulates in G1 phase, while Geminin (mAG-hGem+) accumulates in S and G2 phases. Cells expressing FUCCI probes are divided into red mKO2(+)mAG(-), yellow mKO2(+)mAG(+), and green mKO2(-)mAG(+) emitting populations. The cells were cultivated in Petri dishes at 37 °C in a 5.0 % CO2 humidified environment in McCoy’s 5A (modified) medium GlutaMAX supplement, (ThermoFisher, 36600021, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) without antibiotics. The cells were maintained sub-confluent and harvested by trypsinization at log-phase growth (60% confluency) for subsequent analysis."
