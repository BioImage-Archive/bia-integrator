  "protocol_description": "Cells were seeded onto gold grids (either 'UltrAuFoil' 200 Au mesh, R2/2 gold film, or Quantifoil 300 Au mesh, R2/2 carbon film) and grown to 50% confluency. Grids were then plunge-frozen in nitrogen-cooled liquid ethane using a Vitrobot. To protect the leading edge while milling and reduce surface topography, an organic platinum layer of ~1-2 Âµm was deposited using a gas injection system, followed by two sputter-coated platinum layers before and after the organic platinum layer.",
