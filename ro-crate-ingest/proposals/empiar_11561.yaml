  SpecimenImagingPreparationProtocol:
    - title: "Cryo-ET sample preparation"
      protocol_description: "Cells seeded in a 6 cm dish were treated with 2 µg ml−1 doxycycline for 1 day. Then, 2.0 × 10^5 trypsinized cells were seeded onto Au SiO2 R1.2/20 Quantifoil grids (200 mesh) micropatterned with 30-µm fibronectin circles in the center of grid squares, placed in ibidi 35 mm low dishes (six grids per dish) and incubated in 1 ml of medium for 1 h. After cell attachment, grids were transferred to new ibidi 35 mm low dishes and further cultured in 1 ml of medium containing 2 µg ml−1 doxycycline for 1 day. Cells were stained with 50 nM Halo-JF646 for 1 h to label GEMs and then treated with 0.5 µM rapalog for 30 min. To verify GEM2 expression and labeling before freezing, fluorescence imaging was performed. For freezing, 3 µl of medium was added to the cell side of grids before blotting to reduce cell flattening. Grids were blotted from the back for 1–3 s at 37 °C, 90% humidity and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane at −185 °C on a Leica EM GP2 system, clipped into cryo-FIB auto-grids and stored in sealed boxes in liquid nitrogen."
    - title: "Cryo-FIB lamellae preparation"
      protocol_description: "Cryo-FIB lamellae were prepared using a 45°-pretilt shuttle in an Aquilos FIB-SEM microscope. Metallic platinum was deposited by sputter coating (1 kV, 10 mA, 10 Pa, 15–20 s), and organometallic platinum via gas injection system. Cells were milled to 1-μm thickness at 20° stage tilt with decreasing ion beam currents (1, 0.5 and 0.3 nA, 30 keV) and then thinned to target thickness of 200–250 nm at 50 and 30 pA. Lamellae were thinned at the back at stage tilt of 21–22°, and finally sputter-coated with platinum to reduce charging and beam-induced motion. Milling progress was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (10 keV, 50 pA)."
  ImageAcquisitionProtocol:
    - title: "Cryo-electron tomography with defocus phase contrast"
      protocol_description: "Cryo-TEM montages and tilt series were collected on a Titan Krios G3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Gatan K3 detector and BioQuantum energy filter, using SerialEM. Grids were loaded such that the lamella pretilt axis aligns with the microscope stage tilt axis. Images were acquired at a pixel size of 3.370 or 3.425 Å/pixel at 1.5–4.0 µm defocus, with an electron dose of 2.0–2.5 e−/Å2 per image fractionated over 8–10 frames. A dose-symmetric tilt scheme was used with 2° increments starting from the lamella pretilt (±13°) and an effective tilt range of +56° to −56° using SerialEM. Data were collected with a 70-µm objective aperture and 20 eV slit width."

  AnnotationMethod:
    - title: "Manual particle picking"
      protocol_description: "Initial training set of 161 GEM particles were manually picked from 39 tomograms in EMAN2. Spherical labels of 137 Å radius were generated based on the coordinates of manually picked particles."
      method_type: ["point_annotations"]
    - title: "Deep learning-based GEM particle detection with iterative refinement"
      protocol_description: "GEM particles were detected using a DeePiCt neural network (depth 2, 32 initial features, batch normalization) trained with an increasing number of particles and iterative refinement of coordinates via subtomogram averaging. The network was trained iteratively, expanding from the initial 161 particles from 39 tomograms to a final training set of 1284 particles from 71 tomograms. For CNN application, tomograms were binned to 13.48 or 13.70 Å pixel size and filtered in EMAN2 (filter.low-pass.gauss:cutoff_abs=0.25, filter.highpass.gauss:cutoff_pixels=5, normalize, threshold.clampminmax.nsigma:nsigma=3). CNN predictions yielded peaks after thresholding at 0.5, lamella masking, and size filtering (5,000–50,000 pixels). Results were manually curated to remove false positives (lysosomes, mitochondria, damaged regions, non-GEM structures)."

  Protocol:

      protocol_description: "CTF estimation and motion correction were performed in WARP. Dose-weighted motion-corrected images were exported for subsequent tomographic reconstruction."
    - title: "Tomographic reconstruction"
      protocol_description: "Tomographic reconstruction was performed in IMOD or AreTomo using the motion-corrected, dose-weighted images from WARP."
    - title: "Subtomogram averaging"
      protocol_description: "Subtomograms at 6.85 Å/pixel with box size of 128 pixels and 3D CTF models were reconstructed in WARP. Averaging was performed in RELION with 1,284 particles, I1 symmetry, using a 60-Å-low-pass-filtered map of the encapsulin scaffold (PDB 6X8M) as reference. Subtomogram averaging was used iteratively during neural network training to refine particle coordinates."
