# openapi_client.model.bia_image.BIAImage

This class represents the abstract concept of an image. Images are generated by acquisition by instruments.  Examples:  * A single plane bright-field image of a bacterium. * A confocal fluorescence image of cells, with two channels. * A volume EM stack of a cell.  Images are distinct from their representation as files, since the same image can be represented in different file formats and in some cases different file structures.
