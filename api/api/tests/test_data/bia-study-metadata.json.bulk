Cellpose labels were consolidated by unifying masks with the greatest overlap, provided that any overlapping mask was more than 50% of each stack's area.  After Segmentation, out-of focus z-stacks were removed by calculating normalized variance across all images in the z-stack using code from https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/find-focus#h.plx6cfnctssk, then removing those z-stacks with less than 80% of the maximal normalized variance value in that z-stack, and returning the largest contiguous section of remaining z-slices.  After trimming out-of focus z-slices, each nuclei was segmented for puncta.   For each nucleus: voxels in the bottom 95% of intensity values were removed, as well as all voxels with less than twice the median intensity value. Of the remaining pixels, those not adjacent to any other pixel were also removed.   The resulting image was blurred using a gaussian filter, then segmented using cellpose.  Puncta within a nucleus were combined across z-stacks using the same algorithm that evaluated overlap across z-stacks.

Subsequently, eyes were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich, P6148) for light microscopy (LM) analysis at 4 °C overnight. Eyes were washed in PBS before the cornea was punctured with a 30 G x 0.5 needle. Cornea, iris, lens, and vitreous were removed with a pair of micro scissors and curved forceps. Remaining muscle tissue around the sclera was gently removed and the optic nerve cut as short as possible. \nAfter dissection, the eyecup containing sclera, choroid, RPE and retina was cryopreserved overnight at 4 °C in a 30% (weight/volume) sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S7903) solution and embedded in optimal cutting medium (OCT, NEG50, Thermo Scientific) inside of Tissue-Tek Cryomolds. Samples were sectioned at 20 µm thickness using a CryoStarTM NX70 cryostat. Serial transverse sections were collected on SuperfrostTM Plus Adhesion Microscopy Slides, air-dried for 30 min at 37°C and stored at -70°C.\nSlides with sections for antibody staining were air-dried for 30 min and rehydrated in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. During rehydration slides were covered with ShandonTM coverplates and placed into ShandonTM SequenzaTM racks. Next, slides were incubated in blocking buffer (0.3 % Triton X100, 5 % Donkey or Goat Serum, and 1 % BSA (Serva GmBH, 11926.04) dissolved in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (Peripherin2, Thermo Scientific, 1:200; S-opsin, Santa Cruz, sc-14363, 1:200; PNA, Vector Laboratories, B-1075, 1:1000; M-opsin, Millipore, AB5405, 1:1000) dissolved in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. The slides were kept at room temperature for 30 min and washed with PBS.

Then, slides were washed extensively in PBS and water before mounting with AquaPolymount (Polyscience, 18606) and a 24x50 mm #1.5 coverslip.
