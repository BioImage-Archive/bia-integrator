      "value" : "Morphological modifications and shifts in organelle relationships are hallmarks of dormancy in eukaryotic cells. Communications between altered mitochondria and nuclei are associated with metabolic quiescence of cancer cells that can survive chemotherapy. In plants, changes in the pathways between nuclei, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are associated with cold stress and bud dormancy. Plasmodium falciparum parasites, the deadliest agent of malaria in humans, contain a chloroplast-like organelle (apicoplast) derived from an ancient photosynthetic symbiont. Antimalarial treatments can fail because a small fraction of the blood stage parasites enter dormancy and recrudesce after drug exposure. Altered mitochondrial-nuclear interactions in these persisters have been described for P. falciparum, but interactions of the apicoplast remained to be characterized. In the present study, we examined the apicoplasts of dormant persisters obtained after exposure to dihydroartemisinin (a first-line antimalarial drug) followed by sorbitol treatment, or after exposure to sorbitol treatment alone. As previously observed, the mitochondrion of persisters was consistently enlarged and in close association with the nucleus. In contrast, the apicoplast varied from compact and oblate, like those of active ring stage parasites, to enlarged and irregularly shaped. Enlarged apicoplasts became more prevalent later in dormancy, but regular size apicoplasts subsequently predominated when actively replicating parasites recrudesced. All three organelles, nucleus, mitochondrion, and apicoplast, became closer during dormancy. Understanding their relationships in erythrocytic-stage persisters may lead to new strategies to prevent recrudescences and protect the future of malaria chemotherapy."

Directly after the second sorbitol treatment, cultures were diluted to 2% parasitemia and 5% hematocrit at a total volume of 10 ml. A stock solution of 700 µM DHA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was diluted in culture medium to treat parasites at a final concentration of 700 nM DHA/0.1% DMSO for 6 h at 37˚C. In parallel, a separate culture was treated with 0.1% DMSO diluted in culture medium as a control. Cells of both treatments were washed twice with cRPMI and returned to culture conditions. Blood smears were prepared prior to drug treatment and following the final wash. 24 h post-DHA, cells were subjected to 5% sorbitol for 30 minutes at 37˚C to eliminate mature parasites that survived DHA treatment. Simultaneously, cells that were exposed only to DMSO underwent a mock-sorbitol treatment with iRPMI. Following two washes with iRPMI, cells were returned to cRPMI under normal culture conditions. Control ring-stage parasites and DHA/sorbitol-treated persisters were collected two days post-drug treatment by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)."
