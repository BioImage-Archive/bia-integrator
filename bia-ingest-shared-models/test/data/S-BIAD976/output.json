        "description": "Most neurological disorders share a phenotype of synaptic dysfunction. High-content microscopy is indispensable in the drug discovery process but the sensitivity relies on the accuracy of mature synapse detection. We present a workflow whereby synchronous calcium bursting is measured in GCaMP6f-transduced neurons. The same cultures are then subjected to Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) to label mature synapses, the neurite network and nuclei. The integration of functional and morphological information provides a rich fingerprint of neuronal connectivity, deployable in different experimental conditions. ",

Cortex were dissected from wild type C57Bl6 E18 mouse embryos in HEPES (7 mM)-buffered Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS-HEPES), followed by trypsin digestion (0.05%; 10 min; 37°C) and mechanical dissociation. After centrifugation (5 min at 200g), the cell pellet was resuspended in Minimal Essential Medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated normal horse serum and 30 mM glucose. Cells were plated in Poly-D-Lysin-coated 96-well plates (Greiner μClear) at 10000 - 15000 cells/cm2 and kept in a humidified CO2 incubator (37°C; 5% CO2). After 4 hours, the medium was replaced with 150 μl B27-supplemented Neurobasal medium (NB-B27), containing Sodium Pyruvate (1 mM), Glutamax (2 mM), glucose (30 mM) and Penicillin-Streptomycin (0.5%). For anti-oxidant deprivation, the commercially available B27 supplement minus antioxidants was used. When the neurons were attached, typically 2h after plating, viral particles encoding the calcium sensor were added. AAV-DJ-hSyn1-GCaMP6f-P2A-nls-dTomato for neuron-specific expression of GCaMP6f (the cytosolic calcium sensor) and nls-dTomato (the nuclear counterstain) were used. The plasmid was obtained through addgene and packaged in house with a kit of Cell Biolabs. The obtained crude lysate is sufficient for the described in vitro experiments and does not need further purification. \n0.01 µl of the crude lysate was used per well of a MW96. Transgene expression was detectable after ~4 days and sustained for several (>6) weeks. To suppress proliferation of non-neuronal cells, 0.5 μM arabinosylcytosine was added in 25 μl at the seventh and tenth day in vitro (DIV). \n\nAfter calcium imaging, cultures were fixed and mature synapses were labeled with PLA. PLA is an antibody-based technique for proximity labeling whereby signal is generated when the pre- and postsynaptic markers are in close proximity. Bassoon and Homer are used but PLA also works with other synapse marker combinations. A counterstain for the neurite network (MAP2) and nuclei (DAPI) was performed as well. Fixation of the cultures was done in 2% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min at room temperature. Next, cultures were permeabilized with a 0.5% Triton X-100 solution in PBS for 5 min at room temperature after which 50µL/well Duolink blocking solution was added for 1h at 37°C. Primary antibodies were diluted in Duolink antibody diluent (2µg/mL) and incubated overnight at 4°C (anti-Bassoon; Neuromab; 73-491 and anti-Homer; Synaptic Systems; 160003). After a wash step with wash buffer A for 2 x 5 min (Duolink in situ orange starter kit; Merck Millipore; DUO92102-1KT), cultures were incubated with PLA probes for 1h at 37°C (1:5 dilution; Duolink in situ orange starter kit; Merck Millipore; DUO92102-1KT). After washing the cultures with wash buffer A for 2x5min, ligation solution was added for 30 min at 37°C (Duolink ligation buffer + ligase) after which a 2x5min wash step with wash buffer A was done. Cultures were then incubated with amplification solution (amplification buffer and polymerase 1:80) for 100 min at 37°C. Cultures were counterstained after incubation with wash buffer B for 2x5 min (Duolink in situ orange starter kit; Merck Millipore; DUO92102-1KT) and 5 min with wash buffer A. Incubation with primary antibody was done overnight at 4°C (1:500; anti-MAP2; Synaptic Systems; 188006). Cultures were washed again for 2 x 5 min with wash buffer A after which they were incubated for 2h at room temperature with secondary antibody solution (Donkey-anti-Chicken-AlexaFluor647; Jackson Immunoresearch;\t703-605-155; 0.5 µg/ml). Next, incubation with DAPI solution was done for 10 min at room temperature (5 µg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. A final wash step of 2 x 5 min with wash buffer A was done after which anti-fade buffer was added and plates were sealed (Duolink in situ microplate nuclear stain, anti-fade; Merck Millipore; DUO82064-1KT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
