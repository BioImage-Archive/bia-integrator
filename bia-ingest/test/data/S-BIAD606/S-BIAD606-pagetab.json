Scans were performed under 40 kV/200 μA/8 W or 30 kV/200 μA/6 W settings. Depending on the specimen size and region of interest, a 4×, 10×, or 20× objective was chosen. Exposure times were individually adjusted for each scan, ranging from 0.75 to 6.5 s. To reduce noise, binning 2 was applied during data acquisition. Tomography projections were reconstructed with the XMReconstructor software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) with binning 1 (= full resolution) and TIFF format image stacks as output."
