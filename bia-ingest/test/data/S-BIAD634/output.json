        "title": "An annotated fluorescence image dataset for training nuclear segmentation methods",
        "description": "This dataset contains annotated fluorescent nuclear images of normal or cancer cells from different tissue origins and sample preparation types, and can be used to train machine-learning based nuclear image segmentation algorithms. It consists of 79 expert-annotated fluorescence images of immuno and DAPI stained samples containing 7813 nuclei in total. In addition, the dataset is heterogenous in aspects such as type of preparation, imaging modality, magnification, signal-to-noise ratio and other technical aspects. Relevant parameters, e.g. diagnosis, magnification, signal-to-noise ratio and modality with respect to the type of preparation are provided in the file list. The images are derived from one Schwann cell stroma-rich tissue (from a ganglioneuroblastoma) cryosection (10 images/2773 nuclei), seven neuroblastoma (NB) patients (19 images/931 nuclei), one Wilms patient (1 image/102 nuclei), two NB cell lines (CLB-Ma, STA-NB10) (8 images/1785 nuclei) and a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) (41 images/2222 nuclei).",

        "protocol_description": "Nuclei image annotation was performed by students and expert biologists trained by a disease expert. To accelerate the time consuming process of image annotation, a machine learning-based framework (MLF) was utilized supporting the process of annotation by learning characteristics of annotation in multiple steps. The MLF annotations result in a coarse annotation of nuclear contours and have to be refined to serve as ground truth annotation. Therefore, annotated images were exported as support vector graphic (SVG) files and imported into Adobe Illustrator (AI) CS6. AI enables the visualization of annotated nuclei as polygons overlaid on the raw nuclear image and provides tools to refine the contours of each nucleus. An expert biologist and disease expert carefully curated all images by refining polygonal contours and by removing polygons or adding them, if missing. Finally, an expert pathologist was consulted to revise all image annotations and annotations were curated according to the pathologistâs suggestions. In cases where decision finding was difficult, a majority vote including all expertsâ suggestions was considered and annotations were corrected accordingly. Images were exported and converted to Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files, serving as nuclear masks in the ground truth dataset. To set a baseline for machine learning-based image segmentation methods and to validate the proposed dataset, 25 nuclei were randomly sampled from the ground truth annotations for each of the classes, marked on the raw images and presented to two independent experts for image annotation. Annotation was carried out by a biology expert with long-standing experience in nuclear image annotation, further called annotation expert, and a biologist with experience in cell morphology and microscopy, further called expert biologist. Nuclei were annotated using SVG-files and Adobe illustrator. The single-nuclei annotations, described as single-cell annotations within the dataset, can be downloaded along with the dataset.",
        "annotation_criteria": "The annotation of nuclei in tissue sections or tumor touch imprints is challenging and may not be unambiguous due to out-of-focus light or nuclei, damaged nuclei or nuclei presenting with modified morphology due to the slide preparation procedure. We defined the following criteria to annotate nuclear images: Only intact nuclei are annotated, even if the nuclear intensity is low in comparison to all other nuclei present. Nuclei have to be in focus. If parts of a nucleus are out of focus, only the part of the nucleus being in focus is annotated. Nuclear borders have to be annotated as exact as resolution and blurring allows for. Nuclei are not annotated if their morphology was heavily changed due to the preparation procedure. Nuclei from dividing cells are annotated as one nucleus unless clear borders can be distinguished between the resulting new nuclei."
