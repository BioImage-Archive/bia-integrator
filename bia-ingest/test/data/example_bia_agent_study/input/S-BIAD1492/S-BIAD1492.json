        "value" : "In the experiments using the HL-60 cell line, investigators are usually interested in studying the cell nucleus that occupies most of the cell volume. Therefore, the following text will focus on modeling nucleus shape and texture. When simulating the appearance of the HL-60 standard cell line, we can presume the shape of the initial object to be spherical, as this object type is topologically equivalent to a sphere. However, the basic objects like spheres or ellipsoids are too simple and regular. Because the aim is to simulate real objects, a certain amount of irregularity is required. For this purpose, we used the PDE-based method to distort the object shape. The idea is based on viewing the object boundary as a deformable surface. The deformation is realized with fast level set methods using artificial noise as a speed function. Besides the shape, the texture of the nucleus image profile reveals important information about the cell activity. In each stage of the cell cycle, chromatin has different properties, and hence when stained, it looks different. For these purposes, the study and the measurement of heterogeneity of chromatin is an important task. Essentially, there are two ways to generate synthetic texture: algorithms for texture synthesis and methods for procedural texture modeling. Here, we decided to use the latter one. The texture function is defined as a sum of several Perlin's noise function. However, certain nucleus parts may not contain chromatin and hence may remain unstained. These locations are either left blank (without any texture) or defined as very dark. The latter case corresponds to an unwanted staining effect. The nucleoli might be an example of such an object type that typically appears as a dark (not stained) place in the image of a nucleus. It was discovered empirically that there is only one nucleolus per healthy nucleus in human cells. As for cancerous cells, there might be more than one nucleolus. The shape of such a nucleolus is mostly spherical or slightly deformed. Because of this property, its generation follows the same idea as the generation of the whole HL-60 nucleus."
