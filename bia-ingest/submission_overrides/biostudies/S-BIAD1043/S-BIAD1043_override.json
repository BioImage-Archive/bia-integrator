        "value": "High-throughput imaging (HTI) generates complex imaging datasets from a large number of\nexperimental perturbations. Commercial HTI software for image analysis workflows does not\nallow full customization and adoption of new image processing algorithms in the analysis modules.\nWhile open-source HTI analysis platforms provide individual modules in the workflow, like nuclei\nsegmentation, spot detection, or cell tracking, they are often limited in integrating novel analysis\nmodules or algorithms. Here, we introduce the High-Throughput Image Processing Software\n(HiTIPS) to expand the range and customization of existing HTI analysis capabilities. HiTIPS\nincorporates advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms for automated cell and\nnuclei segmentation, spot signal detection, nucleus tracking, spot tracking, and quantification of\nspot signal intensity. Furthermore, HiTIPS features a graphical user interface that is open to\nintegration of new algorithms for existing analysis pipelines and to adding new analysis pipelines\nthrough separate plugins. To demonstrate the utility of HiTIPS, we present three examples of\nimage analysis workflows for high-throughput DNA FISH, immunofluorescence (IF), and live-\ncell imaging of transcription in single cells. Altogether, we demonstrate that HiTIPS is a user-\nfriendly, flexible, and open-source HTI analysis platform for a variety of cell biology applications"

After fixation, the plates were rinsed three times in PBS\nand stored in PBS at 4 °C. We then conducted high-throughput fluorescence in situ hybridization (hiFISH). Briefly, BAC FISH probes were selected to hybridize to the boundary regions of the topologically associated domain (TAD) on chromosome 7 containing the EGFR gene. Fluorescently labeled BAC probes were generated by nick translation at 14°C for 1 hour and 20 minutes. The reaction mixture included 40 ng/ml DNA, 0.05 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, 0.05 mM dNTPs (including fluorescently tagged dUTP), 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 U/ml E. coli DNA Polymerase, and 0.5 mg/ml DNase I. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 µl of EDTA per 50 µl reaction volume, followed by a heat shock at 72 °C for 10 minutes. Probes were labeled either with DY549P1-dUTP (Dyomics, Cat. # 549P1-34) or with DY647P1-dUTP (Dyomics, Cat. # 647P1-34). The reaction was then stored at -20 °C overnight. Next, the two probes (0.5 mg per probe) were combined, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 14 µl of hybridization buffer (50% formamide pH 7.0, 10% Dextran Sulfate, and 1% Tween-20 in 2X SSC) per well. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and subjected to permeabilization. Permeabilization was performed at room temperature for 20 min using 0.5% w/v saponin/0.5% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS. After rinsing the cells with PBS twice, cells were deproteinated for 15 minutes in 0.1 N HCl and neutralized for 5 minutes in 2X SSC at room temperature. Cells were equilibrated overnight in 50% formamide/2X SSC at 4°C. The probe mix was warmed to 72 °C prior to the hybridization reaction. Next, 14 µl/well of resuspended probe mix was added to the plate and denatured at 85 °C for 7 min, followed by immediate transfer to a 37 °C incubator for a 48-hour hybridization period. Post-hybridization, plates were rinsed once at room temperature with 2X SSC, followed by three rinses with 1X SSC and 0.1X SSC, all warmed to 45 °C. Cells were stained with 3 µg/ml DAPI for 15 minutes, then rinsed and mounted in PBS"

HTI acquisition and analysis has been used to measure the dynamics of these events in large numbers of single live cells. We aimed to compare HiTIPS with our previous image analysis pipeline to show that it can be applied to precisely quantify transcriptional dynamics in live cells at the single-cell level (Fig. 5). To this end, we ran the full HiTIPS analysis pipeline on HTI datasets from two clonal human bronchial epithelial (HBEC) cell lines, in which the ERRFI1 and KPNB1 genes have been endogenously tagged with 24xMS2 loops, enabling visualization of their nascent transcription with MCP-GFP. MS2/MCP-GFP labelled transcription sites in these nuclei were detected, registered, grouped into tracks, and the integrated fluorescence intensity was measured at the site of transcription."
