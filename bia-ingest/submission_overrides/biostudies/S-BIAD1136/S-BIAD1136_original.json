The next day, pieces were washed 3x5 min with PBS and moved to SDS permeabilization buffer for 1-2 days in +37°C. Fixed tissue pieces were then transferred to 25-50ml of CUBIC 1 (1.6 M urea, 5% Quadrol [Sigma, 122262], 15% Triton X-100, 25 mM NaCL [Fisher Scientific, S/3160/60] in ddH2O) and incubated in +37°C for a minimum of 3 weeks, changing the buffer every 2-3 days. Next, the pieces were labelled with DAPI (1:1000-1:3000, [Life Technologies, D1306]) in PBS o/n at room temperature. The areas with TDLU structures were visualized with fluorescence microscopy, and chosen areas cut into pieces of approximately 2-5mm in diameter. Tissues were then permeabilized again using SDS permeabilization buffer for 2 days in +37°C, changing the buffer between the days. The tissues were then washed 3x1h in PBT at room temperature (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and blocked with iFLASH blocking buffer (10% FBS [Sigma, 122262], 5% DMSO [Chem Cruz, 358801], 0.1% NaN3, 1% BSA in PBT) for 1h at room temperature, and incubated in primary antibodies diluted in iFLASH blocking buffer for 3 days (anti-keratin 8 primary antibody 1:100 [Hybridoma Bank, TROMA-1). Tissues were washed 3x1h with PBT at room temperature, and pieces incubated in secondary antibodies (anti-rat secondary antibody (H+L) 1:400 [Thermo Scientific, Alexa Fluor 488]) in +37°C. Finally, the pieces were washed 3x1h with PBT at room temperature, and transferred to 25-50ml of CUBIC2 (1.2 M sucrose [Millipore, 107651], 3.6M urea, 9% triethanolamine [Sigma, 90279], 0.1% Triton X-100 in ddH2O) for a minimum of 2 days in +37°C, or until mounting and imaging.
