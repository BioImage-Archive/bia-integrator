      "value" : "Here, we reconstituted bronchial epithelia from adult and child donors and show that SARS-CoV-2 infections spread fast, resulting in the formation and synchronized release of large clusters of infected cells and syncytia into the apical lumen, contributing to virus dissemination. Some epithelia, for the most part from children, revealed an intrinsic resistance to infection and virus spread. This infection control correlates with faster type III interferon secretion and can be transferred to permissive epithelia through exogenous interferon application. Child epithelia also showed a muted inflammatory response compared with adult, suggesting a specific and age-adapted epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may explain why children are less susceptible to severe COVID-19."

Then, 105 basal cells were grown on cell culture inserts (Corning) within the air–liquid interface for 21 d using PneumaCult ALI medium (Stemcell). Such a culture allows the differentiation into pseudostratified mucociliary airway epithelia composed of ciliated cells, goblet cells, club cells, and basal cells. The complete differentiation was assessed by the capacity of cilia to beat and mucus production under a light microscope."

Z-projections of different focal planes were generated and regions of interest (ROI) were designed to delimit the area of analysis. A threshold was then applied to the projection of both N positive cells and Cytk5 (or tubulin) positive cells in order to obtain respective masks. Masks were analyzed using the “colocalization” function in ImageJ to calculate the number of double positive cells (N and Cytk5). Obtained values were normalized by either total number of N or total number of Cytk5 (or tubulin or mucin) positive cells to calculate the percentage of basal cells (or ciliated/goblet cells) that are infected."
