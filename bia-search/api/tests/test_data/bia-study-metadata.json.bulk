Cells were used within eight passages after thawing frozen vials to ensure the quality of the stem cell culture.\nThe neural progenitor differentiation was performed following the previously published protocol. Briefly, after two passages on feeder cells, mES cells were transferred to gelatin-coated plates without feeder cells, and cultured for two to four passages in the presence of LIF. Subsequently, cells were trypsinized and 4 × 106 cells were transferred to non-coated 10-cm Petri dishes (Greiner, 633102) and cultured for eight days within DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, 10270-106), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, 25030-024), 1 × MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco, 11140-035) and 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, 31350-010) without LIF. The culture medium was changed every two days, and after four days, 5 μM retinoic acid (Sigma, R2625) was added to the medium. After eight days of culture, the aggregates of neural progenitors were dissociated by trypsinization at 37°C for 5 min in the water bath, and the dissociated cells were either immediately used for cryo-EM grid preparation as described below, frozen within the medium supplemented with 10% DMSO and stored until use, or directly used for subsequent neuronal differentiation. For the neuronal differentiation, dissociated cells were seeded on glass bottom plates (ibidi, 80827) coated with poly-DL-ornithine (Sigma, P8638) and laminin (Roche, 11243217001) at approximately 1–2 × 105 cells/cm2, and cultured in N2 medium (1:1 mixture of DMEM (Gibco, 21969-035) and Ham’s F-12 nutrient mix (Gibco, 21765-029), supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 μg/ml insulin (Sigma, I6634), 50 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma, T1147), 20 nM progesterone (Sigma, P8783), 100 nM putrescine (Sigma, P5780), 30 nM sodium-selenite (Sigma, 214485), 50 μg/ml BSA (Sigma, A9418), and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122)) for two days. \nCells were fixed at the indicated time point after seeding in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. For staining, cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton in PBS for 10 min, washed three times with PBS for 5 min each, and blocked for 30 min using 3% BSA-containing PBS (PBS/BSA). After blocking, primary antibodies diluted in PBS/BSA were applied, and samples were incubated overnight at 4°C.

Mouse embryonic stem cell medium was prepared by supplementing EmbryoMax® DMEM (Millipore, SLM-220-B) with 15% FBS (Gibco, 10270-106), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco, 25030-024), 1 × non-essential amino acids (Gibco, 11140-035 or 11140-050), 1 × EmbryoMax® nucleosides (Millipore, ES-008-D), 110 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, 21985-023) and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, 15070-063). mES cells were cultured on mitomycin-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (feeder cells) plated on 0.1% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) in mouse embryonic stem cell medium supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, ESGRO, Millipore, final 1000 U/ml), and kept at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were used within eight passages after thawing frozen vials to ensure the quality of the stem cell culture.\nThe neural progenitor differentiation was performed following the previously published protocol. Briefly, after two passages on feeder cells, mES cells were transferred to gelatin-coated plates without feeder cells, and cultured for two to four passages in the presence of LIF. Subsequently, cells were trypsinized and 4 × 106 cells were transferred to non-coated 10-cm Petri dishes (Greiner, 633102) and cultured for eight days within DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, 10270-106), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, 25030-024), 1 × MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco, 11140-035) and 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, 31350-010) without LIF. The culture medium was changed every two days, and after four days, 5 μM retinoic acid (Sigma, R2625) was added to the medium. After eight days of culture, the aggregates of neural progenitors were dissociated by trypsinization at 37°C for 5 min in the water bath, and the dissociated cells were either immediately used for cryo-EM grid preparation as described below, frozen within the medium supplemented with 10% DMSO and stored until use, or directly used for subsequent neuronal differentiation. For the neuronal differentiation, dissociated cells were seeded on glass bottom plates (ibidi, 80827) coated with poly-DL-ornithine (Sigma, P8638) and laminin (Roche, 11243217001) at approximately 1–2 × 105 cells/cm2, and cultured in N2 medium (1:1 mixture of DMEM (Gibco, 21969-035) and Ham’s F-12 nutrient mix (Gibco, 21765-029), supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 μg/ml insulin (Sigma, I6634), 50 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma, T1147), 20 nM progesterone (Sigma, P8783), 100 nM putrescine (Sigma, P5780), 30 nM sodium-selenite (Sigma, 214485), 50 μg/ml BSA (Sigma, A9418), and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122)) for two days. The medium was changed to fresh N2 medium 2 h and one day after plating. \nFor mES samples, feeder cells were first seeded on 8-well polymer bottom chambered slides (ibidi, 80826) coated with 0.1% gelatin at a seeding density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2. mES cells were seeded on feeder cells at a density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2, and cultured for 24h before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. For neuronal precursor samples, cells were seeded on 8-well glass bottom chambered slides (ibidi, 80827) coated with poly-LD-ornithine and laminin as described above, and fixed at the indicated time point after seeding in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. For staining, cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton in PBS for 10 min, washed three times with PBS for 5 min each, and blocked for 30 min using 3% BSA-containing PBS (PBS/BSA). After blocking, primary antibodies diluted in PBS/BSA were applied, and samples were incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing the samples with PBS, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. DNA was stained with 1 μM of Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 62249).

Spineless, the Drosophila homolog of AHR, has only been studied in the context of development but not in the adult intestine. \nMethods: The role of Spineless in the Drosophila midgut was studied by overexpression or knockdown of Spineless in infection and tumour models and RNA sequencing of sorted midgut progenitor cells.\nResults: We show that spineless is upregulated in the adult intestinal epithelium after infection with Pseudomonas entomophila (P.e.). Spineless knockdown increased stem cell proliferation following infection-induced injury. Spineless overexpression limited intestinal stem cell proliferation and reduced survival after infection. In two tumour models, using either Notch RNAi or constitutively active Yorkie, Spineless suppressed tumour growth and doubled the lifespan of tumour-bearing flies. At the transcriptional level it reversed the gene expression changes induced in Yorkie tumours, counteracting cell proliferation and altered metabolism. \nConclusions: These findings demonstrate a new role for Spineless in the adult Drosophila midgut and highlight the evolutionarily conserved functions of AHR/Spineless in the control of proliferation and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium. \n","keyword":["drosophila","Spineless","aryl hydrocarbon receptor","tumour model","Pseudomonas entomophila"],"acknowledgement":"","see_also":[],"related_publication":[],"grant":[{"id":"220497","funder":[{"display_name":"Wellcome","id":null}]},{"id":"210556","funder":[{"display_name":"Wellcome","id":null}]}],"funding_statement":"This work was supported by Wellcome [220497;

The head was first perfused with 5 L heparinized 0.01 M PBS (10 U/ml of heparin, Ratiopharm), followed by 3 L 4% PFA in 0.01 M PBS for 2-3 h. The veins were finally closed to maintain the PFA to the brain. Then the brains were recovered by calvarian dissection and preserved at least 1-2 weeks for post-fixation submersed in the 4% PFA solution. \nPFA-fixed intact human brain was actively pumped with 5 L 10% w/v CHAPS and 25% w/v N- Methyldiethanolamine solution for one month with solution refreshed once at day 15. Then the solution was changed to PBS for active washing for 2 days. The intact human brain was cooled in PBS at 4 °C overnight, then directly cut into 1.5 cm-thick slices in coronal plane using a Rotation Cutting Slicer (Rotation Schneidemaschine, Biodur, Heidelberg, Germany). The total 12 slices were serially labeled and stored in 70% EtOH at 4 °C. \nA 1.5 cm-thick intact human brain slice was randomly chosen and passively incubated with 400 mL TO-PRO-3 (1:2000 dilution) in PBS at room temperature for 1 week.

After labeling, the slice was washed with PBS for 1 day. The clearing started with dehydration using a series of 1 L of EtOH/DiH2O solutions (50%, 70%, 100%, 100% v/v) and followed by delipidation using 1 L DCM. Each step lasted 1 day. Then the samples were incubated in 1 L BABB solution at room temperature until completely transparency in around 2 weeks.\n1.5 cm-thick human brain slices were randomly chosen and dehydrated with a series of 1 L EtOH/DiH2O (50%, 70%, 100%, 100% v/v), then delipidated with 2 L DCM/MeOH (2:1 v/v), then rehydrated with a series of 1 L EtOH/DiH2O (100%, 70%, 50%, 0% v/v) at room temperature. After incubating with 1 L 0.5 M acetic acid (Roth, T179.1) in DiH2O, this solution was changed to a mixture of 4 M guanidine hydrochloride (Roth, 6069.3), 0.05 M sodium acetate (Sigma, S2889) and 2% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH = 6.0, at room temperature to loosen the extra cellular matrix. The incubation time for each of all above mentioned solutions was 1 day. Next, the slices were shortly incubated with 10% w/v CHAPS and 25% w/v N-Methyldiethanolamine solution for 4 hours and washed with PBS for 1 day. The intact slices were stored in the blocking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100/10% DMSO (Roth, A994.2)/10% goat serum/PBS) at 4 °C.\nRegions of interest (including hippocampus, primary motor cortex, primary sensory cortex, and primary visual cortex, 2-4 cm x 2-4 cm x 1.5 cm) were cut and incubated with the same blocking buffer at 37 °C for 1 day.

Twelve hours afer injection of EB dye, we anesthetized the animals with a combination of midazolam, medetomidine and fentanyl (administered intraperitoneally; 1ml per 100 g body weight containing 5mg, 0.5mg and 0.05mg per kg body weight, respectively) and opened their chest for transcardial perfusion. Medium with WGA (0.25mg WGA conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 dye (Termo Fisher Scientifc, W11262) in 150µl PBS, pH7.2) was supplied by peristaltic pump set to deliver the medium at a rate of 8ml/min, along with 15ml of 1× PBS and 15ml of 4% paraformaldehyde.
