          Accurate quantification of nuclear features is critical for the characterization of tumours. 
          This dataset contains annotated fluorescent images of cell nuclei from a normal human skin cell line, and from different tumour samples from cancer patients. 
          This dataset can be used to train nuclear image segmentation algorithms.
      - value: >-
          The number of cells in an embryo at early stages of development can be used to understand its viability, however counting cells on DIC images is a challenging task. 
          This dataset contains annotated DIC images of mouse embryos to train machine learning models.
