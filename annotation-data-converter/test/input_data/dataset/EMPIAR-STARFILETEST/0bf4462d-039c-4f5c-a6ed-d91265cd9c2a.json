  "description": "Tilt series following motion correction in WARP (*.st), with tilt angle information (*.rawtlt) for tilt series alignment in AreTomo and alignment solutions outputted by AreTomo (*.aln and *.xf). Data acquired with defocus only, no Volta phase plate, on a K3 BioQuantum detector. See README.md under All Files for more information (also copied below).\n\n# Cryo-electron tomography of GEM2-labelled Mito-EGFP in HeLa cells\n\nFive independent cryo-ET datasets were collected. Each dataset is organised under the following directory structure, with the directories \"data/\", \"alignment/\", and \"tomograms/\" each designated as an Image Set.\n\n- data/\n    - CountRef.mrc    gain reference\n    - defects.tif     defect map (K3 data only)\n    - frames/         unaligned, unbinned multi-frame micrographs\n    - mdoc/           MDOC files listing exposure dose, pixel size and tilt angle information for each tilt\n- alignment/\n    - TS_###.mrc/     \n        - TS_###.mrc.st        sorted, motion-corrected tilt series from WARP\n        - TS_###.mrc.rawtlt    tilt angle information corresponding to tilt series\n        - TS_###.mrc.aln       AreTomo tilt series alignment solution\n        - TS_###.mrc.xf        XF file from AreTomo alignment\n    - mdoc_edited/             MDOC files with entries for discarded tilts during alignment removed\n- tomograms/\n    - *.mrc          tomograms reconstructed by weighted back-projection in AreTomo, 4-times binned\n    - ######.star    combined STAR file listing the refined coordinates of GEM2 particles at 6.85 A/px in this dataset\n\nAcquisition parameters differ for each dataset and are specified below. Tilt series were aligned in AreTomo 1.3.1 with the following parameters: 8 by 6 patches (K3 data) or 6 by 6 patches (K2 data), VolZ 2000, AlignZ 1000, TiltAxis ## -1 (as calibrated for the magnification and microsco\npe used), TiltCor 0.\n\n## Dataset 1 (211206) - Image Sets 1 to 3\n\nData acquired with defocus only, no Volta phase plate, on a K3 BioQuantum detector. 2 tilt series. Pixel size, 3.425 A/px.\n\n## Dataset 2 (220330) - Image Sets 4 to 6\n\nData acquired with defocus only, no Volta phase plate, on a K3 BioQuantum detector. 3 tilt series. Pixel size, 3.425 A/px.\n\n## Dataset 3 (220504) - Image Sets 7 to 9\n\nData acquired with Volta phase plate on a K2 Summit detector. 1 tilt series. Pixel size, 3.3701 A/px.\n\n## Dataset 4 (220506) - Image Sets 10 to 12\n\nData acquired with Volta phase plate on a K3 BioQuantum detector. 5 tilt series. Pixel size, 3.425 A/px.\n\n## Dataset 5 (220720) - Image Sets 13 to 15\n\nData acquired with Volta phase plate on a K3 BioQuantum detector. 6 tilt series. Pixel size, 3.425 A/px.",
