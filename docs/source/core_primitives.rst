Core primitives
===============

Study
-----

A high level that holds general metadata about images (who created them, why they were created). 

Image
-----

The abstract concept of an image. Images are generated by acquisition by instruments.

Examples:

* A single plane bright-field image of a bacterium.
* A confocal fluorescence image of cells, with two channels.
* A volume EM stack of a cell.

Images are distinct from their representation as files, since the same
image can be represented in different file formats and in some cases
different file structures.

Image Representation
--------------------

A particular representation of a BIAImage. Examples:
    
* A single HTTP accessible file.
* Multiple HTTP accessible files, representing different channels, planes and time points.
* An S3 accessible OME-Zarr.
* A thumbnail.

Annotation
----------

Extra information that adds to supplments existing metadata at the study, image or image representation level.
